 1. ***** Current Included TextureReplacer Version - 1.4.1 *****
 
 There have been some changes to the way TextureReplacer applies textures to KSP.
 I have written an attempted noob guide to using the new system so please read on.





 2. ***** Installation instuctions *****
 
 The pack you have downloaded comes with TextureReplacer all ready to go with a base 
 install of Green Skull custom spacesuits. The base install depends on pack type.
 
 The pack is located inside the Game Data folder in the download. 
 e.g. --Pack-v0.38\Green Skull Inc\GameData\TextureReplacer


     ***** You have four install options *****

 - Option 1. You do not currently have a TextureReplacer or Green Skull install.

 - Option 2. You are updating from an earlier version of Green Skull Inc. 
             Custom Spacesuits 

 - Option 3. You all ready have the included version of TextureReplacer 
             containing non Green Skull textures.
 
 - Option 4. You all ready have a later version of TextureReplacer containing non 
             Green Skull textures.



 * IMPORTANT * Keep Alternate Textures Folder in a safe place for later! 


      ***** Option 1 *****
 You do not currently have a TextureReplacer or Green Skull install

 - Step 1. DO NOT EXTRACT THE PACK DOWNLOAD TO OR IN YOUR KSP GAME DATA FOLDER! 
           Extract outside only!

           This file is located inside the Game Data folder in the download. 
           e.g. -Pack-v0.38\Green Skull Inc\GameData\TextureReplacer

 - Step 4. Paste inside your game data folder in your KSP install. 
           The address for this should be something like
            C:\Users\Desktop\KSP_win\GameData\TextureReplacer

 You should now have custom spacesuits! For how to change your kerbals textures 
 see below.



     ***** Option 2 *****

 - Step 1. DO NOT EXTRACT THE PACK DOWNLOAD TO OR IN YOUR KSP GAME DATA FOLDER! 
           Extract outside only!

 - Step 2. Open the KSP Game Data folder in your game install. 
           The address should be something like like C:\Users\Desktop\KSP_win\GameData

 - Step 3. Copy your existing TextureReplacer file to desktop or a safe place 
           (So you have a back up copy!)

 - Step 4. Delete the TextureReplacer file from your GameData folder.

 - Step 5.  Copy and paste TextureReplacer from the Green Skull download file into your 
           KSP Game Data file. This file is located inside the Game Data folder in the
           download e.g. -Beta-Pack-v0.38\Green Skull Inc\GameData\TextureReplacer

 You should now have the latest custom suits. For how to change your kerbals textures 
 see below.



     ***** Option 3 *****
 You all ready have the included version of TextureReplacer containing non Green Skull
 textures

 - Step 1. DO NOT EXTRACT THE PACK DOWNLOAD TO OR IN YOUR KSP GAME DATA FOLDER! 
           Extract outside only!

 - Step 2. Open the KSP Game Data folder in your game install. 
           The address should be something like like C:\Users\Desktop\KSP_win\GameData
 
 - Step 3. Copy your existing TextureReplacer file to desktop or a safe place 
           (So you have a back up copy!)

 - Step 4. Copy and paste TextureReplacer from the Green Skull download file into your

           download e.g. -Beta-Pack-v0.38\Green Skull Inc\GameData\TextureReplacer

 - Step 5. The files should merge. Replace all files as requested. 
 
 You should now have custom suits and any custom planets or other textures you had. 
 For how to change your kerbals textures see below.
 
 If custom textures you had before are not in game they are safely saved on your 
 desktop and you can add back in what you want.

 ***** YOU SHOULD ONLY HAVE ONE @ CONFIGURATION FILE INSTALLED *****


  
 3. ***** How the latest version of TextureReplacer works - Attempted noob guide *****

 As of version 1.3.1 TextureReplacer has changed the file and configuration structure
 to assigning textures from fewer folders. This is a small step towards in game
 GUI texture changes! Thanks goto Shaw and his continued work towards this goal :)

 Textures and normal maps are now assigned by configuration rather than location.

 Although this may seem complicated it is actually simplifying the overall texture use
 and the real benefits are the ability to control when and where a texture is applied
 but most importantly multiple charcaters can use the same textures AND multiple
 textures can use the same normal map. LESS RAM USED. Ability to assign IVA suits
 per pod! Easier to assign mutiple characters the same or different suits.

 KSP uses two textures to create the image you see on your character. 

 The texture and the normal (NRM) map
 - 1. The texture is the visible surface of the game object drawn in 2d form.
 - 2. The normal map tells the game where the high and low spots are on the main texture.
      This is to give a raised look and adding to lighting effects to the game object.

 - How this effects you - 
 To work correctly each spacesuit, helmet, jetpack or head requires a texture and 
 a normal map.

 These must be assigned correctly in the TextureReplacer configuration files. How to 
 do this is described later on.




 4. ***** The @GreenSkull configuration file - how it works *****
 The configuration file is a basic set of programming instructions which tells 
 TextureReplacer which textures and normal maps to assign to which charcater and under
 what circumstances. It also controls the appearance of your game character in 
 different situations. 

 When TextureReplacer reads the configuration file it expects to see things 
 written in a particular way. If things are not written correctly TextureReplace will
 not function correctly! Things like SPELLING and bracket placement matter!
 
 For general configuration file information I find this page helpful:
 http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/CFG_File_Documentation

 For instructions of how to change or add textures see below.

 ***** YOU SHOULD ONLY HAVE ONE @ CONFIGURATION FILE INSTALLED *****




 5. ***** How to change / add textures and apply to different situations in game *****
 
 This is a two step process. Yes its complicated when you first read it and I'm sorry 
 the instructions are long and boring but hopefully they will solve any problems you
 may be having and prevent the problems I have seen in the many posts on forums!
 
 This is split into two parts. 
 - 1. How to add / remove individual textures
 - 2. How to configure individual textures

 *NOTE*
 Some previous experience in changing configuration files would be handy but everbody
 has to start somewhere... And I guess some of you will start here so I'll try to 
 explain this as best as I can.
 
 When changing things in the configuration file there are two possible scenarios.
 
 Scenario 1. It works. Texture change has been implimented.
 Scenario 2. It didn't work. Texture change failed. Game may do weird things...

 I suggest ONLY changing the GreenSkull configuration file to apply texture changes as
 this will prevent future conflicts with these supplied textures!

 Things like SPELLING and bracket placement matter!

 ***** ALL INDIVIDUAL TEXTURES CANNOT BE RENAMED THEY MUST STAY AS THEY ARE *****

     ***** Part 1 - How to Add and remove individual textures *****
 
- Step 1. First and most important step... BEFORE YOU MESS ABOUT IN THE TextureReplacer 
          FILE MAKE A COPY On YOUR DESKTOP AS A BACK UP! You will also have a referance
          to use for mistakes.


 - Step 2. Locate the texture that you wish to change. These are located in the 
           Alternate Textures folder you kept in a safe place earlier... 
           Right click and copy.

 The textures you can change are:
 
  - EVA Jetpacks - Which Jetpack texture to use on EVA.

  - Heads - Different head textures.

  - Helmets - Different helmet textures.

  - Suits - Different Spacesuit and Cabin textures.

  - Visor Colours - Different colours and types of visors.

  - Visor Reflections - Different visor reflections e.g. Stars, Skyboxes etc.


 - Step 3. Locate the correct folder for the texture in TextureReplacer.

 The options here are :
 
 - Default - Place textures here to apply to ALL kerbals.
   
 Textures in this folder must have the following name structure:

   Name                    - Description
   
   kerbalHead              - Kerbal head
   kerbalMain              - IVA suit (veteran/Bill Bob Jeb) - can't get this to work
   kerbalMainGrey          - IVA suit (standard/Non custom characters)
   kerbalMainNRM           - IVA suit normal map
   kerbalHelmetGrey        - IVA helmet
   kerbalHelmetNRM         - IVA & EVA helmet normal map
   kerbalVisor             - IVA helmet visor
   EVAtexture              - EVA suit
   EVAtextureNRM           - EVA suit normal map
   EVAhelmet               - EVA helmet
   EVAvisor                - EVA helmet visor
   EVAjetpack              - EVA jetpack
   EVAjetpackNRM           - EVA jetpack normal map

 *IMPORTANT NOTE* You can not change the name of a texture or the Default folder.
 You can change the name of a folder containing an indivdual textrure BUT you must edit
 the configuration file if it is in use OR you plan to use it.

 - EnvMap - Place alternate visor reflections here.
 
 Textures in this folder must have the following name structure:

   Name                    - Description

   GalaxyTex_PositiveX     - skybox right face
   GalaxyTex_NegativeX     - skybox left face
   GalaxyTex_PositiveY     - skybox bottom face, rotated for 180°
   GalaxyTex_NegativeY     - skybox top face
   GalaxyTex_PositiveZ     - skybox front face
   GalaxyTex_NegativeZ     - skybox back face

 *IMPORTANT NOTE* You cannot change the name of a texture or the EnvMap folder.

 -  Heads - Kerbal and Kermin heads go here.

 -  Suits - IVA and EVA suits go here.

 Paste the desired texture in the desired location. The more textures you add the more
 RAM you use. The textures are not big files but if you add a LOT of extra textures
 you will use more RAM. I 100% reccomend Active Texture Manager by rbray89.

 *IMPORTANT NOTE* Although many textures use the same normal map some don't.
 Please refer to the list below for what goes with what...

     ***** How to remove textures *****
 Simply delete the unwanted texture from the appropirate folder in the locations listed
 above. THEN remove the listing for the texture in the GreenSkull configuration file.
 How to edit the configuration file is explained below.



     ***** Part 2 - Configuring your new textures *****  
 I have written some guide lines in the @GreenSkull configuration file to help you in
 the right direction. I'm not going to go into technical terms just simple basics so 
 anyone can add their own custom textures.
 
 A few basic configuration file rules for noobs:
 - lines of code that start with // are ignored by the programme
 - The brackets denote opening and closing of parts of code and are VERY important
 - Each configuration file must open with the programme or part name then {
 - Each part of instruction has to open with a { then - instructions - 
   then close with }
 - At the end of the instructions there must be a } to close the file.
 - Brackets, Spaces, = equals signs, comma's and file name SPELLING are super important
   to getting good results
 
 Bracket format:
   Programme or part name
   {

   { Instructions }
  
   }


 *Note* I have tried to make this explanation as simple as possible and give examples 
 where possible. I have written instructions and examples in the configuration file 
 @GreenSkull



     * How to Change Which texture appears where *

 - CustomKerbals -
 Goto this section of the configuration file to change custom kerbal textures.

 The format is:
 Name         SPACE = Head Texture   SPACE    Suit Texture

 - Step 1. Add your kerbals name. 
 - Step 2. Then a space. 
 - Step 3. Then an = sign. 
 - Step 4. Then a space. 
 - Step 5. Then Suit Texture name in the suits directory.

 The suits directory is the folder containing the custom suit's in TextureReplacer.
 
 The adress will look something like:
 TextureReplacer/Suits/YOUR CHOSEN SUIT TEXTURE FOLDER NAME
 
 e.g Bill Kerman = BILLkerbalHead GSI_Black_Suit
 
 
 
      * How to find an out of game list of names and use on a new custom kerbal * 

 1. Open the save game folder in your main KSP game folder,
 -  The address for this should be something like C:\Users\Desktop\KSP\KSP_win\saves

 2. Open the folder with your save name

 3. Find the file named persistant.sfs

 4. Scroll directly to the bottom and then up for each individual name.

 IF YOU MODIFY ANYTHING IN THE SAVE GAME FILE BY ACCIDENT OR OTHERWISE 
 IT WILL EFFECT YOUR SAVED GAME SO BE CAREFUL IN HERE!!!



 - Default and GenericKerbals -

 To prevent heads from being assigned to generic Kerbals the list must be space- and/or
 comma-separated.
    
 e.g. excludedHeads =  BILLkerbalHead BOBkerbalHead JEBkerbalHead

 To prevent suits from being assigned to generic Kerbals the list must be space- and/or 
 comma-separated.
 e.g.  excludedSuits = GSI_Black_Suit GSI_Blue_Suit KSP_White_Suit

 The other settings for female head and female suit assignment are the same.

 You can change the generic suit assignment. The possible options are random 
 or consecutive.
 
 Simply change suitAssignment = random to suitAssignment = consecutive



 - CabinSuits -
 
 Add your Cabin-specific suits here. These are enforced even if a Kerbal has 
 a custom suit.

 To find your pod or cockpit internal name open the parts configuration file and 
 look for the part where it says:

 INTERNAL
 {
   name = mk1PodCockpit
 }

 Format:
 Part internal name    SPACE  =  SPACE  Suit directory

 - Step 1. Add your pod or cockpits internal name. 
 - Step 2. Then a space. 
 - Step 3. Then an = sign. 
 - Step 4. Then a space. 
 - Step 5. Then Suit Texture name in the suits directory.

 Entries look like this:
 internal name from the cockpit or pod part configuration file = suit directory

 e.g. for the standard mk1 squad pod
 
 mk1PodCockpit = KSP_Orange_Suit

 

 *Note* I have tried to make this explanation as simple as possible and give examples 
 where possible. I have written instructions and examples in the configuration file

 6. ***** Green Skull Inc Texture Normal (NRM) Map List v0.38 *****

 To reduce the size of the download and number of files I have included the bare
 minimum number of normal maps. Most textures use the same as default but if a 
 texture looks funny or has bumps in the wrong place check the list and aply the 
 correct normal map to the folder containing the error texture.

 This list contains the texture name AND the correct name for the Normal (or Bump)
 map for the corresponding texture. Add the normal map to the desired texture folder
 but only IF it is different from the one in the list. 


 All normal maps have the suffix NRM in the name.
 
    - EVA Jetpacks -

 7. ***** EXTRA FEATURES OF TEXTURE REPLACER *****

      - Changing how your kerbals appearance spawns -

 TextureReplacer has a configuration file that can be altered to change how it effects the game.
 Go to the plugin file in the texture replacer (GameData\TextureReplacer\PluginData\TextureReplacer)

 The main character effecting ones are:

     *Spawning with a helmet*
 To change spawning with a helmet in atmosphere change the word true to false.

 // Spawn a Kerbal on EVA in his/her IVA suit without helmet and jetpack when
  // in breathable atmosphere (oxygen + sufficent pressure).
  isAtmSuitEnabled = true

 to
 // Spawn a Kerbal on EVA in his/her IVA suit without helmet and jetpack when
  // in breathable atmosphere (oxygen + sufficent pressure).
  isAtmSuitEnabled = false
 This will mean that now you can wear a helmet on kerbal. To change back simply change the setting back to true.



      - Changing where your character will spawn without a helmet -

 // Minimum air pressure required for a Kerbal to spawn in its IVA suit.
  atmSuitPressure = 0.5

 - Change the number for which planets this will work on. Different planets and moons have different values.


    
       - Turn Visor Reflections On or Off -

 / Replace helmet visor shader to support reflections.
  // Possible options: `always`, `never` and `evaOnly`.
  isVisorReflectionEnabled = evaOnly

 Change this to turn visor reflectons on and off.


 The rest are best left alone unless you have an idea of what they do!



 8. ***** Helpful Hints and Tips *****

 ***** YOU SHOULD ONLY HAVE ONE @ CONFIGURATION FILE INSTALLED *****

 *IMPORTANT NOTE* You cannot change the name of a texture or the EnvMap folder.

 *IMPORTANT NOTE* You can not change the name of the Default folder.
 You can change the name of a folder containing an indivdual textrure BUT you must edit
 the configuration file if it is in use OR you plan to use it.

 If a texture looks funny or has bumps in the wrong place check the Normal map 
 list in section 6 and apply the correct normal map to the folder containing the 
 error texture.

 For the texture to work correctly it must be named correctly in the configuration file,
 placed in the correct order AND in the correct folder. This is most likely the cause
 of your problem. Please refer to the original configuration file written by 
 Green Skull as a starting point for changing textures. 

 Copy and paste names works best!

 If a texture fails to load check that there is only one file with each name 
 e.g. EVAvisor. simply remove the unwanted one.

 Please note EVA reflective visors currently are saved as JPEG images and tinted 
 (see through) visors are saved as PNG images.They must stay like this to work 
 correctly.

 If you don't like any of the new textures simply remove the TextureReplacer file 
 from your Game Data folder and the game is back to stock. 

 EVA means Extra Vehicular Activity = Outside ship.
 IVA means Interior Vehicular Activity = Inside ship.
