# HumanStuff: A (Slightly More) Realistic Spacesuits, Heads & Staff. For KSP v1.8.1 (maybe KSP v1.5+) NEEDS TextureReplacer
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

What is This? A Kerbal Space Program mod to add more realistic visuals for:

- Recreations of "Human" face/hair features (All are 1024x1024 16M .dds files)

- Recreations of real life equipment, flags, patches & logo's (All flags, patches & logo's are public use and allow redistribution) 

- Recreations flight suits, IVA, EIVA, IVA space suites. (All are 4096x4096 16M .dds files), "standard/base" suit's only currently, not vintage or futuristic

- Plus "KSC Staff & Ground Crew" (Small issue with "albino" Gene, but only in Mission Control scene, and same issue with ground crew scientists & "signal lights people"... working on it...)

These are "standard" suit types, not vintage (.V) or futuristic (.F), so as many people can enjoy them as possible & because neither looks very "realistic" compared to the standard suit.

# > This is my 1st mod, and 1st GitHub project, if I did something wrong please tell me. Read note below for credit where credit is due <

Note: Original Head/Face/Hair Textures credited to @GregroxMun, special thanks to @hemeac (great posts on this subject), @Chubby_Hamster (boot textures) & @Jiraiyah (seeing green skull come back gave me this idea) for being able to see how their work was done to make my own. @Oinker's reflections, EvnMap reflections and GalaxyTex skybox (super "light touched" darkened, resized/DDS optimized) used with a few touches (mostly not to the art other than trying my hand at darkening them). If I forgot to credit you (or was rude and didnt talk with you/get reply from you 1st) please let me know.
Anyone may reuse, edit or redistribute these files, as per terms of very forgiving "CC 4 by SA" licence (and its "art" I dont sell or make huge issues of "ownership" on...I only want to be credited, as I did for others.
